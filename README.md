# Transport-System-v2
Web development/Database project
### HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL
Our website is made to facilitate NUST students in registering for NUST transport system. Students can register online, request for route availability, and after registration, have a portal where they can log in to view their route, van and driverâ€™s detail. This website also benefits Admin of the system to keep record of routes, vans, drivers, students and feedbacks given by students.
## Back-end
MySQL database is created which is linked through PHP.

### ASSUMPTIONS:
- Route must have at least 4 students going on it, otherwise, it would not have that much need to be created.
- Vans are of two types: Hiace and Carry van. Hiace and Carry vans have capacity of 15 and 7 students respectively. Van travels on one route only.
- There are some vans that are not assigned to any route which means they are still available in future.
- Password must have length greater than five. **_Passwords are sha512 encrypted._**

Everything else is understandable through EERD.
## Front-end
It is simple HTML CSS based website. It is **not responsive**.
